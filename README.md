## Spaced repetition capstone
This app allows uers to practice learning a language through the spaced repetition revision technique. Users can create an account and have access to a library of characters on the home dashboard.  Users can then practice by being shown a character and submit a guess.  They will then receive feedback with the total score and the correct and incorrect count for that character. The next wcharacters in sequence are determiend by the spaced repetition algorithm.
